Installation of SMART
---------------------------------------------------
Step 1)
Prepare to install SMART
1) edit /etc/hosts. Add to this the ip address of your machine and map it to the name hadoop. 
    For eg., 
    192.168.1.4    hadoop
    127.0.0.1 localhost
    127.0.0.1 platform-dev-debian
2) create a user for SMART using the command
    useradd -m -d /home/smartuser smartuser
    passwd smartuser - enter the password to setup the password.
3) login as smartuser

Step 2)
Install SMART
1) mkdir smartinstall; mkdir scripts
2) Download setupsmart.tar from https://github.com/Rajeshinf/p-smart/blob/master/sm.kernel/src/main/resources/setupsmart.tar
3) cd scripts; tar xvf ../setupsmart.tar
4) ./setupSmart.sh /home/smartuser/smartinstall/ <jdk home directory with a / at the end> <eth0/eth1 or whichever you wish to use>

This will download all the required jars and install SMART and start the SMART server. See FAQ for debugging problems.

---------------------------------------------------
To setup SMART to run as a service:
----------------------------------------------------
Ensure you have setup SMART and it is running using the manual commands before doing this.

Step 1) 
Setup SMART user to login without a password using a key. 
1) ssh-keygen -t rsa
2) cd .ssh 
3) cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys

Step 2) 
Copy the files required and create the appropriate links, so that we can setup a service.

1) ln -s <SMART install path>/runsmart.sh /usr/bin/runsmart.sh
2) cp <SMART install path>/smart /etc/init.d/smart
3) vi /etc/init.d/smart
4) edit the USER variable - set it as the user used to run SMART
4) edit the SMART_INSTALL path -  set it to the installation path of SMART
5) update-rc.d smart defaults 91 -- run this if you want SMART to start up during reboot. You can restart the server to check this.
6) To remove SMART from reboot run update-rc.d -f smart remove

---------------------------------------------------
To test flows in SMART
---------------------------------------------------
There is a simple html test client included with the installation that can be used to deploy and test flows.
1) Open FlowTest.html in a browser
2) Enter the server details and click on connect to smart
3) Enter the jar to deploy and click on Deploy and Enable
4) Now you can use the Post to SMART section to post different events to SMART.

The status messages in JSON format returned by SMART is shown in the STATUS Message box. List results are shown in the results section.
This is a very primitive test tool and helps you get started with writing a client.
smartcom.js can be accessed from fixchg.com. The js files that you write can be derived from this to inherit the standard SMART client functions.

FAQ:
---------------------------------------------------
1) How do I manually startup smart server?
To do this, you have to first make sure hadoop and hbase are running. To run hadoop and hbase:
cd smart_install_path/hadoop
./startupdb.sh
Access http://<IP Address>:60010 on a browser to ensure hadoop is running.
cd smart_install_path
./startSmart.sh SecureServer true

2) I have done all the steps in the installation, my server is not running.
There can be various reasons for this. The most common reason is that the hadoop database server has not yet come up when SMART server was run. 
To ensure hadoop is running, try to access http://<IP Adress>:60010, if this page comes up, then hadoop is running. Restart the smart server as above.

3) SMART installation stopped in the middle of a download, how can I recover. 
Note down the file which did not download. Remove the partially downloaded file from the directory indicated in the output. Rerun the installation.
SMART scripts are written to ignore downloaded files and hence will continue from where it left off.
